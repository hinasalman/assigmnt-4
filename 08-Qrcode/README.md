# QR Code Encoder / Decoder Project

## 📚 Overview

This project allows you to generate and decode QR codes easily using Python. It includes two main functionalities:

1. **Generate QR codes with custom data and save them as images**
2. **Decode QR codes from saved image files**

---

## 🛠 Libraries Used

- `qrcode` — for generating QR codes
- `opencv-python` (cv2) — for decoding QR codes from images
- `Pillow` — for image display and manipulation

---

## ✅ Installation

Before running the project, install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install qrcode
pip install opencv-python
pip install pillow
```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Run the script**
2. Choose one of the following options:
   - **1**: Generate a QR code
     - Enter the data you want to encode.
     - Enter the filename (it will automatically save as `.png` if you don’t add an extension).
     - The generated QR code image will be saved and displayed.
   - **2**: Decode a QR code
     - Enter the filename of the QR code image.
     - The decoded data will be printed.
   - **3**: Exit the program
